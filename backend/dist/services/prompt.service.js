Style guidelines:
- Use simple, rhythmic language for a ${age}-year-old.
- Character: Use ${childName} as the protagonist.
- Tone: Start cozy, transition to gentle adventure, and end with "sleepy-heavy" vibes.
- Sensory Focus: Include soft sounds (rustling leaves, gentle wind) and calming scents.
- Interaction: Add 1-2 tiny pauses or gentle questions for ${childName} to keep them engaged.
- Pacing: Shorten the sentences and use "softer" words (e.g., drift, glow, hum, snuggle) as the story reaches the end.
- Conclusion: A specific "goodnight" ritual within the story (e.g., tucking in the stars).

    Task: Translate the following English bedtime story into natural, flowing, and warm Burmese.

    IMPORTANT TRANSLATION GUIDELINES:
    - DO NOT translate word-for-word. Focus on the *meaning* and *feeling*.
    - Use "Natural Burmese" (Speaking style/Literary style mix that sounds good for storytelling).
    - Use polite and warm expressions (e.g., using "ကွပ်" or "ဗျ" where appropriate for dialogue, or warm sentence endings).
    - The tone should be soothing, magical, and perfect for reading to a child at bedtime.
    - Adapt colloquialisms to culturally appropriate Burmese equivalents.
    - Keep the formatting (paragraphs) consistent with the original.
    - Output ONLY the Burmese translation. No introductory text.
